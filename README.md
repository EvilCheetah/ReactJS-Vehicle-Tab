# ReactJS Vehicle Tab

This is the fourth visualization project. It was written to understand what is the best way to display the fleet. Mainly, I was focused on the dynamic rendering, using `useEffect` hook. Also, tweaked CSS animations a bit to make a webpage be a bit alive.

## How to Run

Before running the project, make sure the dependencies are installed.
In order to do that, run `npm i`.

To test the app builds, run `npm run build`.
To view the visualization, run `npm start`.
